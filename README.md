A small project to keep track of reservoir levels, as reported by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. One script, "update.py" updates the database. The other, "reservoir.py" provides a web front-end for accessing the information.

Currently this project requires the python sqlite3 library, and the flask web framework to function.
